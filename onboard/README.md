This folder contains the onboard "firmware" that operates the keyboard caps and layout.
I say "firmware" in quotes because it stretches the definition a bit.
In reality it's just a gpio server on a pi or arduino.
This can be done in any language we can get to work cleanly with our gpio interface.
I recommend python if we use pi, as a throwback to 130. #nostalgia
